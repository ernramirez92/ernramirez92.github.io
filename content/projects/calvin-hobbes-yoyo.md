# Calvin and Hobbes Yoyo

![Group Photo](/images/projects/yoyo-group.jpg)

This was a team project developed for MIT's **2.008 - Design and Manufacturing II** course, which emphasized manufacturing processes, equipment control, systems, and design for manufacturability.

## Project Overview

The project involved designing and fabricating a custom yoyo featuring Calvin and Hobbes theming. The yoyo combined multiple manufacturing techniques: two injection molded parts, a thermoformed insert, and two laser cut pieces.

## Manufacturing Process

- **CAD design** in SolidWorks
- **CNC tool path creation** using MasterCAM
- **CNC machining** on Bridgeport Mill and CNC lathe

## My Role

I designed and manufactured the thermoform mold from aluminum. Key features included:

- Hand-drilled vacuum holes for thermoforming optimization
- Press-fit mounting pins allowing post-thermoform shearing
- Adjustable lip diameter design to accommodate injection molding variations
