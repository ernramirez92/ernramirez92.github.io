# Contour

MIT's 2.009 - Product Engineering Process class is the capstone course for mechanical engineers. In the class, you work in large teams of approximately 20 individuals to design and build working alpha prototypes of new products. We learned about creativity, product design, working within a budget, and gained unifying engineering experience.

For our project, we decided to address a major issue with prosthetics. Fit. A residual limb is a sensitive body part that is placed in a rigid object. Though out the day, the shape of a residual changes slightly which can drastically effect the fit and comfort of the prosthetic. We leveraged granular jamming to prototype a socket and liner system that would improve an amputees prosthetic experience.

My major role was prototyping and developing and verifying the pneumatic system for Contour and iterating on liner system though user feedback. This characterizing the jammed sleeve stiffness as a function of pressure to the speed at which the pressure monitoring electronics needed to operate.
